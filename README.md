# Introduction
On the 23rd of September,2022 I started the Zuri training cohort II as a Fullstack (Frontend and Python) development trainee. This repo consists of my week 3 to 5 projects during the training. 

## Projects

### Week 3

#### Python Task: OOP, Classes and Objects Project (Quiz)
This was a python task in week 3. I was given some questions to answer. This quiz is in week 3 branch on this repo. It is called "Python Quiz question". it is a single document on the first page. It is not in a folder.

#### Tasks CSS Fundamentals project.
This was a Frontend task. In this task we were required to : 

1. Create a simple portfolio website with the following information: about me section, contact page, services section, project.
2. Using HTML semantics, we were to include a header, main, and footer tag. 
3. Then we should add a navigation menu at the top of the home page. 
4. We should also use inline linking to the sections on the home page and make the other pages, like contact us, open up a new page.
    
##### The following should be included in the portfolio: 

1. My name
2. A paragraph about myself
3. Projects (everything I have done, both zuri and outside.)
4. Services 
5. Hobbies, priorities, and other skills
6. Somewhere on the page where it makes sense visually, I am to add a photo of myself.
7. Name
8. Email
9. Message

<li> All the images used are in a folder called "img". </li>
<li> The image used as the icon when the page is loaded is saved as "Muushe.ico". it is the only image that is not in the img folder.</li>

#### HTML and CSS Log in/Registration, Success page project

   1. The user can only access the success or congrats page when they enter the correct info in the fields provided.
   2. The Success and Congrats page is only accessible through the log in / register pages.  
   Create the following pages using HTML CSS

This HTML CSS log in task is in a folder titled "Log in replit task".

<li> In this folder, the register page is the index.html. In other words, it is the first page that the user will see.</li>

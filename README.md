#### TASK EXPLANATION

This HTML CSS log in task is in a folder titled "Log in replit task".

In this folder, the register page is the index.html. in other words, it is the first page that the user will see.
If you click the "sign in", you will be automatically redirected to the Lon in page.
The log in page is titled "log in.html" in the "Log in replit task " folder.
If the user clicks on "sign up" the user will be redirected to the Register page.
Now, the register and log in pages will only load success pages, when the fields have been filled with the necessary information. if the user does not suppy the information, then , the user will not access or see the log in pages.
